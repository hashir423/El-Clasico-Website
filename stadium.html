      <h2>Santiago Bernabeu</h2>
      <p>The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu [esˈtaðjo sanˈtjaɣo βeɾnaˈβeu̯]) is a football stadium in Madrid, Spain. With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.[2]

The Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world's most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010.[4] The final matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship and a FIFA World Cup final.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>On 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to Santiago Bernabéu and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old Ramin Amin. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>The construction of Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona's previous stadium, Camp de Les Corts, had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou was used. The June 1950 signing of László Kubala, regarded as one of Barcelona's greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.[6][7][8]

The architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo García-Barbón.[9]

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>The stadium's capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team.[13] The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0.[14] Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics.[15] In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.[16]
