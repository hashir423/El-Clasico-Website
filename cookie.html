  <p class="ph"><strong>Use of cookies across our communication channels is detailed below.</strong></p>
<p>When you visit our websites (the “Websites”) or social media sites or use our apps (the “Apps”), you may provide us with two types of information: (i) Personal Information - which you knowingly choose to disclose, that is collected on an individual basis and is used in accordance with our Privacy Policy; and (ii) Website and App Use Information which is collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse the Websites, use the Apps or interact with our social media sites, and is used as set out in this Cookies Policy.

You can surf the Websites anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. However, for the purposes described in this policy, we use “cookies” to measure your visits to our Websites. A cookie is a small text file that our Websites store on your device or web browser and can later retrieve. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of the Websites, but this information only allows us to identify you personally if you have previously logged on to the Websites from that device as a member of an El Clasico membership scheme, or where you have visited a Website by clicking through from a Club communication (such as an email) that you have received as a member.

We also use cookies on our Websites and social media sites which are used when you share information using a sharing button or “like” button, or when you click on links on the official El Clasico social media pages on sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The companies that deliver this functionality, and the operators of the sites, will record that you have done this and this information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities.

If you choose not to delete and/or block cookies from the Websites, and continue to use the Websites, you are thereby consenting to our use of such cookies.</p>
<p class="ph">App Use Information</p>
<p>When you access our App on a mobile device, we use technologies that enable us to receive information from your device about the screens you have viewed.
The Apps use third parties services such as Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics and other similar services to collect this usage data, along with personally identifiable information such as personal details, device identifier or location. The data collected helps us to enhance your experience using the Apps and allows us to provide you with more relevant content.</p>
